            <h2>Movie Description:</h2>
            <p>A cryptic message from James Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover the existence of a sinister organisation named SPECTRE. With a new threat dawning, Bond learns the terrible truth about the author of all his pain in his most recent missions. (IMDb)</p>

            <h2>What Are People Saying?</h2>
            <h3>Critics Reviews</h3>
            <p>"It is a tired retread that offers little new or original, taking 007 to the one place he's arguably never been before: irrelevance." - MovieFreak.com</p>
            <p>"'Spectre' isn't the best of these films, but it may well be the most thought-provoking, because there's always something fascinating about art at war with itself." - Flavorwire</p>
            <h3>Critics Consensus</h3>
            <p>Spectre nudges Daniel Craig's rebooted Bond closer to the glorious, action-driven spectacle of earlier entries, although it's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula. (Rotten Tomatoes)</p>
