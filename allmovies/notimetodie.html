        <h2>What Are People Saying?</h2>
        <h4>Critics Reviews</h4>
        <p>"Daniel Craig's Bonds are not a bad place to start with [the character]. His Bond feels real, relevant to this time and immediate." - WXIX-TV (Cincinnati, OH)</p>
        <p>"The film's sole distinction is the fact that it's the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore." - Observer</p>
        <h4>Audience Consensus</h4>
        <p>It's very long and packed with plot, but No Time to Die says goodbye to Daniel Craig's Bond with all the action and excitement franchise fans expect. (Rotten Tomatoes)</p>
        <h2>Movie Ratings:</h2>
        <p>84% Rotten Tomatoes</p>
        <p>88% Audience Score</p>
