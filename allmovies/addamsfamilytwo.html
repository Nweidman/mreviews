        <p>"With Wednesday - The Addams Family's most interesting character - getting centre stage, this is a fun improvement on the 2019 movie." - Movies4Kids' Jo Berry</p>
        <p>"I did not like The Addams Family 2. I did not like it at all. And that's all I have to say on the matter." - MovieFreak.com's Sara Fetters</p>
        <h4>Audience Consensus</h4>
