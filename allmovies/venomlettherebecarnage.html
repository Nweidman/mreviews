        <h4>Critics Reviews</h4>
        <p>"It's dumb. It's loud. It barely makes a lick of sense. But unlike its predecessor, this second cinematic outing for the popular Marvel antihero is also a heck of a lot of fun." - MovieFreak.com's Sara Fetters</p>

        <h4>Audience Consensus</h4>
        <p>With tons of action, fun fight scenes, and plenty of comedy, Venom: Let There Be Carnage gives fans everything they'll be looking for -- plus a can't-miss post-credits surprise.</p>
