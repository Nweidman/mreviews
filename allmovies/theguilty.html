        <h2>What Are People Saying?</h2>
        <h4>Critics Reviews</h4>
        <p>"Gyllenhaal works hard to make Baylor a more conflicted character. Yet in humanizing him the film also reduces an institutional failing into an individual one." - Austin Chronicle</p>
        <p>"If you come to this Netflix remake first, you are going to be blown away by a hurricane-force performance from Gyllenhaal." - Time Out</p>
        <h4>Critics Consensus</h4>
        <p>The Guilty is another Americanized remake overshadowed by the original, but its premise is still sturdy enough to support a tense, well-acted thriller. (Rotten Tomatoes)</p>
