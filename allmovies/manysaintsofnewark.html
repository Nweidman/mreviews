            <h2>What Are People Saying?</h2>
            <h3>Critics Reviews</h3>
            <p>"The movie was, to borrow an image from the "Pine Barrens" episode, like sucking ketchup packets." - Boston Globe</p>
            <p>"I walked out of the theatre wishing for a limited TV series rather than a movie. Although The Many Saints of Newark offers an alluring glimpse into Tony Soprano's birth under a bad sign, it never shows the blue moon in the mobster's eyes." - Austin Chronicle</p>
            <h3>Audience Consensus</h3>
            <p>Sopranos fans will enjoy seeing younger versions of some of their favorite characters, but the story may confuse casual viewers while frustrating the faithful.  (Rotten Tomatoes)</p>
